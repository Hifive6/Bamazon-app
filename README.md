This is an application builder using MySQL and Node.js. It is built to resemble a customer buying a product on Amazon.

The file will run and the customer will be shown a table of all available products in the MySQL database. The customer will choose the product using a product id and then be prompted how many of this product they would like to purchase. If there is no quantity then the will be prompted to go back to the main menu to pick another product.
